## Description
This repository is used for practicing and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms concepts. 
It provides an organized structure to solve problems.
The idea is to start from a quick and simple solution and gradually improve it.
This approach helps to learn different methods of solving a problem and optimize solutions over time.

## Repository Structure
The structure for solving a problem is as follows:

- **Title:** The name of the problem.
- **Problem Definition:** A clear and concise description of the problem.
- **Constraints:** The conditions under which the problem must be solved.
- **Examples:** Sample input and output to demonstrate the problem.
- **Test Cases:** A set of diverse test cases to ensure the correctness of the solution.
- **Solutions:** A step-by-step approach to solving the problem.

## Problem-Solving Approach
When solving a problem, the following approach is used:

**Initial Solution:** Write the first quick solution that comes to my mind. 
**Optimization:** Think about ways to improve the initial solution, reducing time complexity or memory usage.  
**Optimal Solution:** The final solution is often the most optimal one, in terms of both time and space complexity.  
**References:** Any solution taken from external sources will be properly referenced.
